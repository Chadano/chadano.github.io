        <h1>Info</h1>
        <p>Hey, I'm Chadano (formally known as MrBeeBenson).</p>
        <p>
            This is my little home on the internet where I like to show off things I have written or created! Here I will likely talk about myself, anything relating to open-source software and GNU/Linux ecosystems and anything relating to software (including software I create myself!)        
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm a software developer and information activist, I seek to promote accessible, reliable information about free and open source software in my blog posts and write-ups. I am 17 years old, and I am very passionate about computers and technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            I first started learning website development in 2017 from school and fell in love with programming, from there I began to teach myself as much as I could. I was introduced to GNU/Linux and open source software in August 2020 and swapped from Windows 10 to Linux full-time in October 2020. I fell in love with open source software and the philosophy behind it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have recently converted back to Windows after giving the OS another try. I quickly fell in love with both Windows Terminal as well as Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2), and without them I would not have been able to convert back to Windows. My love for Open Source Software still runs strong, and I will continue to create and contribute to FOSS software.

            <a href="https://github.com/chadano/wsl-get">wsl-get</a> - wsl-get is a tool which handles a collection of .deb packages that I (and contributors) use often when utilising WSL2. Rather than manually typing a wget command to download package files, this little tool automates the download and installation of packages.
